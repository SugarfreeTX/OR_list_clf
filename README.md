# OR_list_clf
I built a/some classifier for a task at my job at Baylor Scott &amp; White Research Institute. It classifies/attempts to classify an O.R. (operating room) list. This is a multi-class classifier.  
I also had to build a pipeline to remove the brackets in the spreadsheet and also encode the categorical values. I also built a classifier to populate missing values for the Service columns since Service was a variable needed for classifying the 'Primary Categ' column (the main reason for building this classifier).
